# Accessibility-in-LLM-generated-code

This repository contains the replication package for the paper previously submitted to FSE 2025.

We provide **prompts**, **code**, **results sheet**, and **indicators for UI-related files**.


## Prompts
The prompts we used in our experiment are located in `prompts` folder, available in both pdf and txt formats for easy reference.

## Code
The code used in our experiment is available in `src` folder. Within this, `generation` folder contains the files related to code generation and summary generation. Each file name indicates the specific prompting technique applied. `filtering_process` folder contains the implementation of metrics we used for the filtering process. 

## Results Sheet
The full results of our accessibility evaluation are compiled in the `Results.xlsx` file. It includes the violation ratios for each web project generated by LLMs in every settings, along with the averaged results for clearer insights.

## UI-related Files Indicators
The file extensions and code snippets we used to determine if a file is related to UI is provided in `ui_related_indicator` folder.
